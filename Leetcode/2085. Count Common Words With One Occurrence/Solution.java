/* https://leetcode.com/problems/count-common-words-with-one-occurrence/

Given two string arrays words1 and words2, return the number of strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.

 

Example 1:

Input: words1 = ["leetcode","is","amazing","as","is"], words2 = ["amazing","leetcode","is"]
Output: 2
Explanation:
- "leetcode" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
- "amazing" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
- "is" appears in each of the two arrays, but there are 2 occurrences of it in words1. We do not count this string.
- "as" appears once in words1, but does not appear in words2. We do not count this string.
Thus, there are 2 strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.
Example 2:

Input: words1 = ["b","bb","bbb"], words2 = ["a","aa","aaa"]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no strings that appear in each of the two arrays.
Example 3:

Input: words1 = ["a","ab"], words2 = ["a","a","a","ab"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only string that appears exactly once in each of the two arrays is "ab".
 

Constraints:

1 <= words1.length, words2.length <= 1000
1 <= words1[i].length, words2[j].length <= 30
words1[i] and words2[j] consists only of lowercase English letters.

    public int countWords(String[] words1, String[] words2) {
        Map<String, Integer> map1 = new HashMap<>();
        Map<String, Integer> map2 = new HashMap<>();
        int count = 0;

            map1.put(word, map1.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
        }
        for(String word : words2) {
            map2.put(word, map2.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        for(String word : words1) {
            if(map1.get(word) == map2.get(word) && map1.get(word) == 1) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}

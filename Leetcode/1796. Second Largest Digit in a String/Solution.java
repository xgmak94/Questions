/* https://leetcode.com/problems/second-largest-digit-in-a-string/

Given an alphanumeric string s, return the second largest numerical digit that appears in s, or -1 if it does not exist.

An alphanumeric string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and digits.

Example 1:
Input: s = "dfa12321afd"
Output: 2
Explanation: The digits that appear in s are [1, 2, 3]. The second largest digit is 2.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abc1111"
Output: -1
Explanation: The digits that appear in s are [1]. There is no second largest digit. 

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of only lowercase English letters and/or digits.

    public int secondHighest(String s) {
        int first = -1;

            if(Character.isDigit(c)) {
                int n = c - '0';

/* https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-between-highest-and-lowest-of-k-scores/

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] represents the score of the ith student. You are also given an integer k.

Pick the scores of any k students from the array so that the difference between the highest and the lowest of the k scores is minimized.

Return the minimum possible difference.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [90], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: There is one way to pick score(s) of one student:
- [90]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 90 - 90 = 0.
The minimum possible difference is 0.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [9,4,1,7], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are six ways to pick score(s) of two students:
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 4 = 5.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 1 = 8.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 7 = 2.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 4 - 1 = 3.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 4 = 3.
- [9,4,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 1 = 6.
The minimum possible difference is 2.
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= nums.length <= 1000
0 <= nums[i] <= 105

class Solution {
    public int minimumDifference(int[] nums, int k) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i <= nums.length - k ; i++) {
            int currMin = nums[i+k-1] - nums[i];
            
            min = Math.min(min, currMin);
        }
        return min;
    }

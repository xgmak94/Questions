/* https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-recent-calls/

Write a class RecentCounter to count recent requests.

It has only one method: ping(int t), where t represents some time in milliseconds.

Return the number of pings that have been made from 3000 milliseconds ago until now.

Any ping with time in [t - 3000, t] will count, including the current ping.

It is guaranteed that every call to ping uses a strictly larger value of t than before.

Example 1:
Input: inputs = ["RecentCounter","ping","ping","ping","ping"], inputs = [[],[1],[100],[3001],[3002]]
Output: [null,1,2,3,3]

class RecentCounter {
    Queue<Integer> q;
    public RecentCounter() {
        q = new LinkedList<>();
    }
    
    public int ping(int t) {
        q.add(t);
        while(q.peek() < (t-3000)) {
            q.remove();
        }
        return q.size();
    }

/* https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-importance/description/

You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee's unique id, his importance value and his direct subordinates' id.

For example, employee 1 is the leader of employee 2, and employee 2 is the leader of employee 3. 
They have importance value 15, 10 and 5, respectively. 
Then employee 1 has a data structure like [1, 15, [2]], and employee 2 has [2, 10, [3]], and employee 3 has [3, 5, []]. 
Note that although employee 3 is also a subordinate of employee 1, the relationship is not direct.

Now given the employee information of a company, and an employee id, you need to return the total importance value of this employee and all his subordinates.

Example 1:
Input: [[1, 5, [2, 3]], [2, 3, []], [3, 3, []]], 1
Output: 11
Explanation:
Employee 1 has importance value 5, and he has two direct subordinates: employee 2 and employee 3. They both have importance value 3. So the total importance value of employee 1 is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.

/*
// Employee info
class Employee {
    public int id;
    public int importance;
    public List<Integer> subordinates;
};
*/

class Solution {
    public int getImportance(List<Employee> employees, int id) {
        Map<Integer, Employee> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(Employee e : employees) {
            map.put(e.id, e);
        }
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        int importance = 0;
        q.add(id);
        
        while(!q.isEmpty()) {
            Employee e = map.get(q.poll());
            for(int i : e.subordinates) {
                q.add(i);
            }
            importance += e.importance;
        }
        return importance;
    }
}
